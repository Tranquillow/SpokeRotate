# SpokeRotate by Riley Tranquillow

It's a program where some circles rotate while being linked together and junk.

## Features

- Works with virtually infinite number of circles \(I've tried ten thousand and it works albeit at one frame per second\)
- Toggling outlines on/off \(should've increased the frame rate but it doesnt help much\).
- Commands scrolling towards the bottom
- Info about the circles
- Randomized parameters affecting the circles' attributes
- Randomizer seed tied to the CPU's clock speed, so it will change from CPU to CPU
- Alternate view without circles and at a %20 scale
- Resizable window
- A window icon

Requires CMake >3.11 and [raylib 5.0](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/) to be installed already.

## Installation

``` bash
cmake -B build && cmake --build build
```
